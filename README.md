# Grid-Penalties
Simple script to calculate the actual starting grid after penalties have been applied in Formula 1

Formula 1 grid penalties are often confusing and unclear as to how they are applied. There is no official graphic that comes out to confirm the actual starting grid until hours after qualifying has ended. 

# Functionality
Create a list of the qualifying order

Create a list of tuples of the driver and their associated grid penalty

Enter the values into the function and you should get the actual starting order for the race

# TODO:
See if you can retreive qualifying order and penalties from Formula 1 API
